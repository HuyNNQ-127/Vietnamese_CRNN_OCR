# Vietnamese_CRNN_OCR

## Overview

Vietnamese_CRNN_OCR is an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system designed to recognize and extract text from images, specifically tailored for the Vietnamese language. This project utilizes Convolutional Recurrent Neural Networks (CRNNs) combined with the Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss function to accurately predict sequences of characters from input images.

## Features

- **CRNN Architecture**: Integrates convolutional layers for feature extraction and recurrent layers (Bidirectional-LSTM) for sequence prediction.
- **CTC Loss**: Employs CTC loss to handle sequence alignment issues, allowing the model to learn from unsegmented input-output pairs.

## Model
